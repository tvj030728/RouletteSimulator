  // Strategy Explanation Section
  strategy_explanation: "Strategy Explanation",
  martingale: "Martingale",
  martingale_explanation:
    "The most classic and simple betting system. Double your bet after each loss, and return to the initial bet after a win. Theoretically, you can recover all losses with a single win, but there's a risk of exponential bet increases during losing streaks.",
  fibonacci: "Fibonacci",
  fibonacci_explanation:
    "Uses the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...). Increase your bet to the next number in the sequence after a loss, and move back two steps after a win. The bet increases are more gradual than Martingale, but the profit rate is lower during winning streaks.",
  labouchere: "Labouchere",
  labouchere_explanation:
    "A cancellation system using a sequence of numbers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5). The bet is the sum of the first and last numbers in the sequence. After a win, remove the two numbers used; after a loss, add the bet amount to the end of the sequence. Profit is made when all numbers are cancelled. Complex but flexible strategy.",
  dalembert: "D'Alembert",
  dalembert_explanation:
    "Based on mathematical equilibrium theory. Increase the betting unit by 1 after a loss, and decrease by 1 after a win. More conservative than Martingale with slower bet increases but lower risk. Most effective when win/loss probability is close to 50%.",
  paroli: "Paroli",
  paroli_explanation:
    "The opposite concept of Martingale, also known as 'Reverse Martingale'. Double your bet after a win, and return to the initial bet after a loss. Usually resets after 3 consecutive wins. An aggressive strategy that maximizes profits during winning streaks while minimizing losses.",
  tips_and_warnings: "Tips and Warnings",
  tip_1:
    "In real casinos, table limits prevent infinite progression of the Martingale strategy.",
  tip_2:
    "The Labouchere strategy has lower risk when the sequence is kept short.",
  tip_3:
    "The Fibonacci strategy has more gradual bet increases than Martingale, but requires more wins to recover losses.",
  tip_4:
    "The D'Alembert strategy is conservative but will result in losses if the win rate is below 50% in the long run.",
  tip_5:
    "The Paroli strategy can maximize profits during winning streaks, but winning streaks are rare so it often resets.",
  tip_6:
    "No betting system can overcome the mathematical edge of the casino in the long run.",
